### Thank you
Last but not least, I would really appreciate you for taking the time to review my project so far, this is just such a simple project having done in my spare time - around 15 -> 24 hours (I'm pretty busy at that time) can't express all my abilities and experiences, so I hope I can have opportunity to talk and discuss with you more about the iOS development.
If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è and happy coding! üíª
